# Criterion A

### Scenario

My client is my IT/computer science teacher in the Russian school. During the interview I understood the problem he faces in the daily teaching basis - the students have to train for competitive programming competitions, and the trainings require carefully made problemsets which are organised and accessible for the students. The school doesn't have a centralised system to store the trainings and navigate between them, as well as providing interesting study information. This decreases the overall student interest in the competitive programming field and makes it more difficult for my teacher to provide helpful materials to the students.

My teacher suggested to create a number of programming trainings on different topics and come up with a rational way of structuring the links to them, as well as providing additional learning materials and information. There is currently no need in a very advanced system, but I had to make my product as flexible as possible. The main problems that can arise in the process of development are the old technical services which should be used and the specific requirements of the field of competitive programming.

### Rationale

My response to my teacher's request is to make a set of trainings on a world-class competitive programming training platform named Codeforces and to create a modern, nice-looking website in order to make the trainings accessible for every student at school.

The students will be able to see all the trainings structured by difficulty level and topics covered and all the links to them, as well as navigate additional learning information and helpful resources on both competitive and practical programming. The real-time scoreboard for school competitive programming team members will also be included to increase the competitiveness level and thus boost the learning process.

The website will be made using Jekyll, a fast, adaptive and modern static site generator. The stack used to make the trainings themselves is the Polygon platform which is a native Codeforces problemsetting tool. The website and the trainings will be made according to the following criteria:

1. UI design
2. Website structure
3. Trainings creation
4. Technology
5. Testing
6. Deployment

The final result should provide my teacher with an easy-to-use learning tool which will help him in teaching and make an independent learning platform for the students of different year levels.

### Success criteria

1. Accessibility - the website should present all the information in a beautiful way on all devices and browsers.
2. Performance - the website should be fast to load and responsive to the user's actions.
3. Educational value - the trainings must teach the students some problem-solving skills and be a practical way of checking the knowledge.
4. User interface - the website and trainings should be easy to navigate and use in order to focus on the knowledge and practice part.
5. Content - the trainings and the website should provide a variety of content and information on different topics.
6. Internal structure - it should be easy to extend, change and remove information, as well as give the admins full control over the content.
