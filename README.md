# Computer Science Internal Assessment

This repository is for documentation and criterion works only. The link to the actual IA product repository will be available soon.

### Structure

The criterions are located in the corresponding markdown files in the root folder. Their assets and additional files are in `/img`.

### IA link

The link to the production IA repository will be available here. The project is located in a separate repository for technical reasons.

It is also not a great idea to put the IA documentation into the same place as the working project on production because of possible confusions and preprocessing errors. The errors will come out as the project will be deployed directly from the GitHub repository, and it is technically easier and more practical in terms of implementation and adding IA documentation to deployment exceptions.
