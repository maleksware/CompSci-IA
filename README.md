# Computer Science Internal Assessment

This repository is for documentation and criterion works only. The link to the actual IA product repository will be available soon.

### Structure

The criterions are located in the corresponding markdown files in the root folder. Their assets and additional files are in `/img`.

### IA link

The link to the production IA repository will be available here. The project is located in a separate repository for technical reasons.

It is also not a great idea to put the IA documentation into the same place as the working project on production because of possible confusions and preprocessing errors.
